**Q. How can I find the DID of a public entity? Is there a list?**

**A.** Neither the Sovrin Foundation nor Evernym maintains a publicly accessable list of DIDs, in keeping with the ideals of decentralization that are important in the Self Sovrin Identity community. It is anticipated that vertical market associations, accrediting agencies, and the entities themselves will distribute DIDs to interested parties.
