**Q. How can an entity get its DID written to the ledger as a Transaction Endorser or a Transaction Author?**

**A.** Any Sovrin Steward can write a transaction to any Sovrin validator pool establishing an entity's DID as a Transaction Endorser (TE) or a Transaction Author (TA). However, before doing so on the MainNet, the steward must assure that the appropriate pledges have been filed with the Sovrin Foundation. Currently, such pledges include an agreement to pay for ledger writes, for which the entity will be billed. In the future such payments will be automated by means of a digital token.

Anyone wishing for a DID on the other Sovrin pools may get it using the Sovrin [self-serve portal](https://selfserve.sovrin.org/), or can request it from any steward, or from [support@sovrin.org](mailto:support@sovrin.org). There is no charge for any transaction on networks other than MainNet.
