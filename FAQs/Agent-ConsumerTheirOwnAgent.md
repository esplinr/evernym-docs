**Q. Can individual people run their own agents or become an agency?**

**A.** Technically, yes they can. However, most individuals will not be or are not technically inclined enough to do this and to stay on top of it properly. Most people will choose to use an organization which will handle the agent for them according to the user's instructions, or will use a pre-built app like Connect.Me.
