**Q:Â Are agencies privy to personally identifiable information (PII) when conducting communications between agencies and other agents?**

**A:** The typical communication path for credentials and for proofs is edge-agent -> agency -> agency -> edge-agent. Communications are encrypted end-to-end, that is: edge-agent to edge-agent. Encryption/decryption keys are held by the respective edge agents, not by the agencies. Thus, agencies do not have access to PII.
