# Evernym Community Code of Conduct

Thank you for choosing to participate in the Evernym community. We take seriously our responsibility to help you be effective in meeting your goals.

Evernym public projects are the focus of a community of contributors that consist of professionals and volunteers from all over the world. Together, we work to be a welcoming and respectful community. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:

* be friendly and patient,
* be welcoming,
* be considerate,
* be respectful,
* be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others,
* when we disagree, try to understand why.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intendedâ€”a guide to make it easier to communicate and participate in the community.

This code of conduct applies to all public spaces managed by Evernym. This includes online chat, mailing lists, bug trackers, events such as developer meetings and socials, and any other forums created by the company that the community uses for communication. It applies to all of your communication and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats, things you say, slides, videos, posters, signs, or even t-shirts you display in these spaces. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may, in rare cases, affect a person's ability to participate within them, when the conduct amounts to an egregious violation of this code.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing support@evernym.com. For more details please see the Reporting Instructions below.

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion or lack thereof, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone's primary language.
* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of this community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the community.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others.** Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* **In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.** Persisting in such behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and our community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. Our strength comes from our varied community consisting of people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.


## Questions?
If you have questions, please feel free to contact Evernym by emailing support@evernym.com.


## Reporting Instructions
If you believe someone is violating this code of conduct, we ask that you report it so that Evernym staff can investigate.

All reports will be kept confidential whenever possible. We strive to protect the identity and safety of reporters. In some cases we may need to make a public statement of some form, in which case we will use the minimum of details and identifying information necessary to protect our community. In rare cases, we may need to identify some of the people involved to comply with the law or protect other potential victims. In these cases, we will consult with the reporter to understand their wishes as we decide how to respond to the report.

In your report please include:

* Your name and contact info, so that we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up.
* Names of any individuals involved, including nicknames and/or pseudonyms.
* List any witnesses, including names, nicknames, and/or pseudonyms.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record such as a mailing list archive or a public chat log, please include a link and/or screen shots.
* Any extra context you believe relevant for us to understand the incident.
* State whether you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, immediately notify appropriate law enforcement.

## What Happens After a Report is Filed?

You will receive an email acknowledging receipt of your report.

Evernym staff will review the incident and determine:

* Whether an investigation is needed, including interviewing additional parties or witnesses;
* What appears to have happened and;
* Whether the behavior constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct.

If a member of Evernym staff is one of the individuals included in the report, Evernym employment policy will govern our handling of the report.

Once the investigator is comfortable with the results of the investigation, they will make a decision as to how to respond. Actions taken may include:

* Nothing, if we determine that no violation of this Code of Conduct has occurred.
* A private reprimand to the individual(s) involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed break from Evernym controlled spaces (e.g. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or chat channel).
* A request for a private or public apology.
* A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability plan.
* An abuse report filed with a provider of a community platform such as Twitter, GitHub, GitLab, or YouTube.
* A temporary or permanent ban from some or all Evernym controlled spaces, such as events, meetings, mailing lists, chat, etc.

Once the investigator has determined the action to take in response to the report, Evernym will contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) is intended. Evernym will also contact the recipient of the action to inform them of the report and our intended action. We will take into account feedback from all parties, but Evernym's decision regarding how we manage the community around our public projects is final.
