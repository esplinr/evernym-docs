# documentation-public

Documentation that can be posted on public-facing websites.

## Organization

The content is organized by major topic, listed in alphabetical order.

All of the folders you initially see are listed in alphabetical order. When you open each folder to see its contents, you'll notice that the folder's contents are also listed in alphabetical order.

This was done on purpose for the easy location of content.

## Snippets

Each piece of information about a given topic is created in small sections, called **snippets.**

Each of these snippets is then pulled in through the use of templates, CSS, and yaml files on the back end, to create a viewable and searchable website(s) on the front end.

Snippets create reusable content for multiple audiences and viewing locations, while allowing us to update these multiple viewing locations at once, just by updating the snippet here in the repository.

For example, if only one part of a feature is updated, then only that one section of documentation will need to be updated here in the repository. When that's done, the templates, CSS, and yaml files go to work automatically presenting the updated information anywhere in the multiple viewing locations where that content may already exist.
