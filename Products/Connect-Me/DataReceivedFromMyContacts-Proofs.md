## Proofs

Once you have various credentials in the app, you can then begin submitting those credentials as proofs to others who may request them from you. In the previous example, we used the bits and pieces of a home address as a claim that was formed from a credential. Now if you have someone requesting proof of just the city you live in, then you are able to offer just that once piece of information, showing that it is valid, without having to provide the other pieces from the other credentials you have.

When you receive a request for proof, you see the notification and the fields that are being requested as proof on the same screen. In most cases, if you already have a verified credential with the necessary information, the fields will automatically be filled in for you. For the purposes of this example, that is exactly what is happening.

The procedure is the same as working with credentials. The notification process is the same. You can then choose to send the proof as requested by tapping **Send** or to ignore the request by tapping **Ignore**. Once you send the proof, you see a success message.

You have the ability to choose each of the pieces of information in the above screen and swipe to change which credential you want to provide that information from, if you have other credentials that verify the same pieces of information. You can swipe on the **address** field, for example, and choose the address field from another connection. You also have the ability to choose from self-attested credentials when completing a proof. (They are not shown in this example.)

When you open the new request, the app will let you know whether you need to fill in any of the fields manually or not.

**1. Tap *OK* to get into the request for proof.** 

Scroll down until you find the field(s) you need to enter manually. Tap them and enter the information as necessary.

**2. Tap *Generate*, and the rest of the fields will auto-populate for you.**

As you scroll up and down, you can see on the right-hand side of the screen where each piece of information came from. You can see that because most of those fields came from one organization, they are most likely verified information.Â The ones you filled manually show your avatar, indicating that the information is most likely self-attested.

**3. When you're ready, tap *Send*.** 

The information is sent back to the organization that requested it. You can see the status just as with credentials. You can see it sending, sent, and then you see the status change in the history list.

As always, you can now open it and see what was sent.
