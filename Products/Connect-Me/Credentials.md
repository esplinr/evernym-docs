## Credentials

Periodically, you'll be offered credentials by another party. You may or may not already have a connection with them. Once you've established a connection with the Connect.Me app, you'll be able to receive these credentials. They are then automatically stored in the wallet within the app.

When you receive an offer of a credential, you see all of the items in that credential. Even though all of these items came from the other party, they can be extracted individually so that you can offer different combinations of proof when you need to.

The notification of the credential offer and the credential offer appear as other notifications from your phone. After you open the app you see a red dot next to the connections that have new notifications pending. If you want to accept these items, tap **Accept**. Alternatively, you may ignore the credential offer by tapping **Ignore**.

When you tap **Accept** you get a success message.

When you tap again on the Institution icon from the home screen of the app, you see the history updated. You can see that the credential has been shared with you. You can also tap the credential to view the information it contains.
