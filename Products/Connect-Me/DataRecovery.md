## Data Recovery

The Data Recovery feature takes you through the process of backing up your user wallet and then recovering the wallet, along with everything in it.

Your wallet includes:

* Your keys
* Your payment addresses
* Credentials

**1. To begin, tap the red banner bar on the *Home* screen.**

The app generates a random recovery passphrase. 

> **ALERT:** You MUST record the recovery passphrase and not share it. Anyone who has this passphrase can restore your wallet to a different device and then impersonate you.

**4. Tap *Export Encrypted Backup*.** Once the file is exported, you should move the file to a safe location on your app.

**5. Your device may or may not prompt you to choose a method of exporting the file.** 

When you're finished, tap **Done**.

**6. If you need to reinstall the Connect.Me app and use your backup file, be sure to you do not *Fresh Install* during the app's initial setup; instead, choose the option that allows you to use a backup file.** 

Follow the prompts to finish.

Later, when you've had more activity in the app, you'll see a prompt indicating you have new information to be backed up. To do this, simply perform the same steps starting by tapping on the banner.
