## Prerequisites

To perform this demo, you will need four machines. These can be physical machines, virtual machines or a combination of both. Each of them will need to be running Ubuntu 16.04. One machine will be used to run the indy client. The other three will be used to run each of the three agents involved: Fabre, Acme, and ThriftBank.
