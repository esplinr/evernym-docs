The proof req template icon is the fifth icon down from the top. These templates are used to construct proof requests, which organize the data requests you might need from an end user.

**3. Add as many fields as necessary.**

As in other examples, if you add a field but do not fill it in, you will get a red validation message. This was omitted for simplicity's sake. Click the **Create** button.

If you were successful, you'll get a success message. You'll also see the new proof type listed in the proof type list now available for you to choose from, which will also now appear in other applicable drop-downs elsewhere in the system.
