The  web user interface is an example of a UI that you could create to interact with the SDK. This UI is what the Institution agency would see when interacting with its own backend process while interacting with end users that are connecting to the Institution agency with the Connect.Me app. We built this example UI to call into the SDK.

This UI is a browser-based interface that will work in a browser from a desktop, laptop or tablet. _If you're running this on an iOS device using a Safari browser, please note that it is supported only by iOS 10 and up._ Although some have used it in its current condition, we strongly recommend building a UI that meets your specific business needs. It's meant to show you how a UI can hook into your own backend systems using the SDK.

As we work through these examples, the screen shots that are presented here may contain different data within each of the fields. This is because the screen shots were taken at different times with different users and are only presented here for the purposes of demonstration and example. Clarifications will be noted where necessary to avoid confusion.

All connections and communications between the Institution and the end user are automatically encrypted.
