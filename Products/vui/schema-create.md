The Schemas icon is the fourth icon down from the top. As you can see in this example, some schemas already exist. (On this same screen you can create a new credential definition as well.) If you want to create a new credential definition type, you must first create a schema for it. The software has the capacity to create and define other types of fields in addition to the ones below.

**2. Fill in the *New credential definition* dialog.**

Leave the `Schema Seq No` field blank. Fill in the amount of tokens you want to charge for this type of credential and click **Create a new schema**.

**3. Begin filling in the different fields for your new schema.**

Choose from the drop-down on the right the type of field it should be.

**5. Write down the `Schema seq no` when it appears.**

You will need this number later to create a new definition. If you get a `schema seq no`, this means that your new schema has been successfully written to the ledger. It also appears in the *New credential definition* dialog. This dialog allows you to go straight into making a credential definition based on the schema you just created, if desired. However, if you accidentally close this dialog without writing down this schema number you won't be able to view it later. (This will be changed in later versions.)
