To request proofs from end users, use the **PROOFS** tab, which is the next icon after **CREDENTIALS**. The functionality of proofs is similar to credential offers in some ways and different in others.

### Steps

**1. Navigate to the *Proofs* tab.**

The Proofs list shows no entries until a proof request is sent to the end user. Just as with credentials, the status will appear next to the proof request once it has been sent back by the end user using the Connect.Me app. Status can be **Requested** or **Received**.

**2. Click on the *REQUEST DATA FROM A CONNECTION* tab.**

The *Request data from one of your connections* dialog is displayed.

**3. Choose the proof definition type from the drop down menu on the left and the name of the connection from the drop down on the right.**

In this dialog do not fill in any of the fields. Instead, this dialog shows the end user which fields you're requesting proof of. It is up to the end user to send you back proof of these fields with the appropriate information built from one or more of their already stored, previously verified credentials within the Connect.Me app.

A successful confirmation dialog is displayed.

The proof request you just sent will then appear in the **PROOFS** tab. The end user will see a push notification in the Connect.Me app.
