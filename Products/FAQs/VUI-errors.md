# Verity UI gives an error: "Oops... Something went wrong. Duplicate Schema: Ledger Already Contains Schema For Given DID, Version, and Name Combination"

This error occurs when there is a problem with writing a schema. The most common reason is because the Transaction Author Agreement date in the VUI config file is invalid.
