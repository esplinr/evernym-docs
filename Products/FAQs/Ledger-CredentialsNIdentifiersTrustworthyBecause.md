**Q. Are credentials and identifiers within the Sovrin Network considered trustworthy because of the cryptology involved, the fact that the structure is governed by the Sovrin Foundation or both?**

**A.** The simple answer is "Both." There are two aspects to trust. First is the technical framework that ensures that data on the ledger cannot be altered. This is inherent in the functions of the Indy Code Base which the Sovrin Ledger is built off. To add to that you have strong cryptography protecting the data. Secondly, you have to be sure of the source of the information and transactions. This is where the technical framework is then guarded by the Sovrin Foundation. The Sovrin Foundation guards who is allowed to become Trust Anchors and thus are able to vouch for the source of the information.
