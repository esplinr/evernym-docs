**Q. Will there be a vetting process for issuers who want to onboard into Sovrin to prevent fraudsters from issuing fake college transcripts?**

**A.** As an issuer, you would need to write a public DID to Sovrin ledger, that states who
you are. In order to prevent fraud, only approved Sovrin Trust Anchors are able to write
to the ledger, so as an Issuer you need to either be a Trust Anchor (which requires
being invited by a founding Steward or another Trust Anchor) or an approved Trust
Anchor would need to agree to write the DID on your behalf. And of course, the level of
assurance of an issue can be defined using a domain specific trust framework.
