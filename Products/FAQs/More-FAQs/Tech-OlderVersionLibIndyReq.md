**Q. Why does my libvcx build require an old version of libindy?**

**A.** The extensive testing required for Evernym to release a build takes time during which development work on libindy progresses. All of these packages are being developed so quickly that itâ€™s possible for the libvcx release build to lag behind the publicly available libindy build.
