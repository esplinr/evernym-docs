**Q. How can I see what transactions are on the ledger?**

**A.** Any transaction on any ledger can be retrieved using `libindy` calls. A community member has created a server that uses this capability to periodically pull new transactions from all of the Sovrin ledgers into a local database. This information is then made available for display in a [web page](https://indyscan.io/home/sovmain)
