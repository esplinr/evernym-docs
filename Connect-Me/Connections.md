## Connections

To first receive credentials or present proofs of any kind within the app, you must first create authorized connections between you and another party. On the opening screen of the app you can see that there are no connections. At the top there is the orange Sovrin Token icon, displaying the balance of Sovrin Tokens you have. In the upper right is the notification icon. New notifications are displayed there.

The avatar placeholder is at the bottom. The gear icon on the bottom left is for app settings. The plus icon on the right allows you to add a connection yourself, which will be covered in a later section. For now, connection requests will be coming from the other party.

### Steps: Connection Request by Others

**1. When a connection request first arrive, you see both the invitation and then a pop-over explaining that you need to allow the Connect.Me app to use the camera.** 

You may also see one requesting permission to send you notifications.

**2. Tap *Allow*.**

A message shows that you're now connected. The home screen of the app will show your new connection as an icon. Any credentials or proofs you've received or sent will be stored in the wallet the app already initialized for you.

**Note:** If for any reason the acceptance of a connection request or offer fails, currently the app will not tell you.

> **NOTE:** We will cover the Data Recovery function in a few moments. Let's continue with the Connection.

Tapping on a connection in the app will show a history screen.

The connection requests from other parties may have time-limit expirations on them, so if you wait too long to complete the connection request via the link you received, you may get the expiration screen.

### Steps: Forming Connection Requests via QR Code

**1. From the home screen tap the plus icon on the bottom right of the screen. This opens up the QR code reader.** 

The QR code reader is constantly scanning and will accept the first QR code it successfully reads.

**2. Hold the QR scanner over the QR code.** 

Scanning the QR code completes the remaining connection steps, as you follow the prompts to complete the connection. It is a fast way to make a connection.
