## Pending Items

When you tap on a connection in the app, you see the history of your connection with that person or Institution.Â The history includes credentials you've received, proofs you've offered, and what is pending, if anything.

The credential in the following screenshot was in the process of being accepted. While it was doing that, it read as "pending."

Once you accept it and it finishes receiving, you see the confirmation. This is the same screen you saw earlier when you accepted the police report credential. It's the same for the "Draper-Autocred" credential. Once completed, it also says "Received."
