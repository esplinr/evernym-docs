## Introduction

Connect.Me is available for both iOS and Android. For iOS devices it works with iOS 9 and later.

This app allows your agent on your device to interact with the Agents within your chosen Agency, in this case, Evernym. <!--Is Evernym the agency or the agent in this scenario--> The Agents within the Agency then interact with the Sovrin ledger to provide you with valid pieces of your identity, your accomplishments, and more.

This provisioning is done in the form of verifiable credentials. These Credentials are verified either through your own attestation or through the attestation of a third party, which may add further credibility to your Credentials and Proofs.

All connections and communications between the Institution and the end user are automatically encrypted.
