To use TouchÂ ID, place your finger on the Home button of your device and follow the instructions on the screen. Touch ID is available for iOS and certain models of Android. For this example, a passcode will be used.

**3. Tap *Use Passcode*.** 

Enter your numerical six-digit passcode. Letters are not allowed. When you've entered the passcode once, you'll be asked to enter it again.
