# VCX Instant Web Application

This training module is a customizable Web App using NodeJS Express and Libvcx. The purpose of this is to set up and run a VCX server that can access all of the functions of Libvcx from a web-based interface. This package can be installed and instantly accessed using a Vagrant VM on any host machine in a few minutes, which drastically cuts down the time needed to install, provision, and create a prototype or demo that can be customized and begin to issue Credentials and Proofs right away. 

The VCX Instant Web App differs greatly from the Verity UI in that it is engineer-oriented, written in standard NodeJS (using Node Express server) with a standardized REST API interface for triggering Libvcx operations. It also exposes more of the back end for tinkering, configuration, deconstruction, and reconstruction for any repurposing. 

## Environment and Preparation

VirtualBox and Vagrant are used in this configuration, running the VM from the install directory.

## Installation

There is a bash shell script that sets up and installs itself and is fairly self-explanatory.
