# Building VCX Command-Line Tools

To better understand how to operate functions and implement flows of
credential exchange in VCX, this tutorial illustrates how to generate your
own set of command-line client tools that perform the following tasks:

1. Write a schema to the ledger
2. Write a Credential Definition
3. Establish a VCX connection request
4. Offering a credential to a connection
5. Issuing a data share request to a connecton
6. Validating data share requests

Building these command line tools will teach you how to use the VCX wrappers to
call functions to complete credential exchanges with connections
through the VCX process. These simple functions will give you all the
foundational tools needed for more complex future projects.
