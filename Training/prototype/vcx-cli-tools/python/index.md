# Building VCX CLI Tools - Python

This Tutorial will teach you how to build a single NodeJS script that will act as a very simple CLI, or "command-line interface" for all of the necessary VCX actions needed to connect with a Connect.me mobile app user and exchange credentials and data share requests with them. This CLI script can be used to later build more complex VCX Applications for your demos and prototypes.
