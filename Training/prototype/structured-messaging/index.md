# Structured Messaging in Connect.me

Structured messaging is a new system in Libvcx that allows you to send
messages, notifications, questions, and interactive verifications through any
Sovrin-enabled Wallet app. Here we will be using Connect.me, Evernym's
Decentralized Identity Mobile app in order to send a series of messages to a
Connection.

Structured Messaging can be used in multiple ways; including:

1. Allow the Identity Holder to trigger an event with a response.
2. Send a message or notification to the Identity Holder that is cryptographically secure.
3. Query the endpoint to assure that it is correct and valid.
