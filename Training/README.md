# Training Tutorials

This repository is a sub-module of the new Evernym training, in which the plain markdown content of the training portal technical tutorials will be housed. Based upon your individual outcomes, we have selected some training plans for you below:

## Verity-UI Demo

Build a demo of Credential Exchange using Verity-UI and Connect.me. This is a perfect way to get started working with the following :

1. Schema and Credential Definitions
2. Connections using Connect.me
3. Credential Issuance
4. Data Share Requests

Using the Verity-UI instances and Connect.me for mobile devices, you can quickly brand and create a demonstration of secure Credential Exchange. This is a perfect place to start the learning process of how Credentials will be exchanged and verified in a Decentralized Identity ecosystem.

## Install and Provision

Using Ubuntu 16.04 and a VM, install and provision an instance of Libvcx in order to create a platform for coding your own demo or prototype.

## VCX CLI Tools

Using a provisioned and installed instance of Libvcx with wrappers, you can use this tutorial to create a command-line interface script (in Python or NodeJS) to complete the following tasks:

1. Create a Connection to an Identity Holder with Connect.me.
2. Create and write a Schema to the Staging Net.
3. Create and write a Credential Definition to the Staging Net.
4. Build and Issue a Credential to an Identity Holder through Connect.me
5. Issue a Data Share Request and verify it through Connect.me

This is a great tutorial for those who want to delve into the Libvcx codebase and learn how to write their own code.

## Getting Started with The Credential Village

The Credential Village isn't just a demonstration of a web app in action, it's also a tool for you to use in your demos and prototypes! You can quickly code against the Credentials you receive in the Village walk-through and learn how to write your own Data Share Requests.

## VCX Web App

Set up your own persistent Location (just like the Credential Village) to Issue Credentials and Data Share requests automatically. The VCX Web App allows you to write a simple endpoint REST API in order to process a Credential issuance and Data Share verification from a web site. This relies on some server/client code using NodeJS and a VCX service.

## Structured Messaging

Learn how to use the newest Libvcx feature, structured messaging, in order to send messages, ask questions, and process responses from any Connection.

<!-- ## Agent to Agent Demo with Verity-UI

If you want to create an Enterprise to Enterprise application but don't have the time to code the entire thing from scratch, use this quick Tutorial to set up a demo of an Exchange between 3 Agents using your 2 instance of Verity UI and Connect.me. This can speed up your demo or POC process without needing to write a line of code. -->

## Enterprise to Enterprise

One of the most requested, but least documented tasks using Libvcx is an Enterprise to Enterprise communication. This tutorial delves into how to set up an automated exchange between 2 servers *without* using Connect.me. In this tutorial, Connection Requests, Credential Issuance and Data Share Requests are all handled automatically between two Enterprise Agents, without a Consumer wallet app.

## Getting Started with Verity Server

An introduction to Verity Server, the newest product from Evernym. If you want to create Credential Exchanges with a few lines of simple code, this is what you're looking for. Using Java or Python, you can set up your own Credential Exchange process and let Evernym take care of the rest.
