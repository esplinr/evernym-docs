## Interoperability

Interoperability is a key principle in the Evernym and Sovrin future strategy. Agents, Credentials, DIDs, and other forms of data and identification should be ledger-agnostic and interchangeable. But how do we build a universal protocol that works for everyone in the digital identity ecosystem? By connecting multiple standards to community-sourced protocols Evernym strives to work horizontally as well as vertically.

### Hyperledger Aries

[Hyperledger Aries](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries)  provides a shared, reusable, interoperable tool kit designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. It is infrastructure for blockchain-rooted, peer-to-peer interactions. This project consumes the cryptographic support provided by Hyperledger Ursa, to provide secure secret management and decentralized key management functionality.
