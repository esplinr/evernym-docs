## Privacy and Security

Data privacy and security is one of the most encompassing issue of the modern technological age. In a world where we are constantly forced to share personal data with unknown entities and unknown levels of security of that data, the lack of trust in the ownership and stewardship is now ubiquitous. The SSI system of Decentralized Identity, Verifiable Credential Exchange, and encryption allows for secure transport of data, *without that data being seen or stored in multiple siloes*. This means that the methods with which you validate your identity can now be free of sharing the data and be free from data breaches. SSI is a system of personal information exchange that removes the threat of theft and surveillance from the individual **and** removes the liability of that data from the Enterprise.
