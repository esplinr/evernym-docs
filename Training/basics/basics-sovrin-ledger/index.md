## The Sovrin Ledger

The Sovrin Ledger is the "Blockchain" component of the Self-Sovereign Identity system. The Sovrin Ledger is a Distributed Ledger, which is run by a RBFS (redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithm called Plenum. The Sovrin Ledger is a public, permissioned Ledger, where validation is performed by a pool of Validators that have been officially designated. This is unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum in that the state of the Ledger is upheld by a pool of specific servers, and not cryptocurrency "miners". The Sovrin Ledger, therefore, is accessible to read by anyone, but writing to is requires special permissions. You can find out more [here](https://sovrin.org/) at Sovrin.
