## Proofs and Predicates

What's in a Proof? How do we prove Credentials? The Proof is the 3rd Pillar of SSI (after Connections and Credentials), in which any Credential that has been Issued to an Identity Owner can be verified with multiple restrictions and predicates. Once a Credential is issued to an Identity Owner, it is theirs and remains in their wallet. A data object called a "Proof" can then be issued to the Identity Owner through a Connection, which will then ask some questions about some Attributes. A Proof can request the specific values of these Attributes or request only "some" information about the Attributes, like if the value is lower or higher than a number or simply that it exists. This type of information "about" a value is called a Zero Knowledge Proof, and is intrumental in preventing personal information from being shared or correlated with other entities. Proofs are how we consume a Credential, and how we can validate a person's Identity instantaneously with a very high level of assurance.
