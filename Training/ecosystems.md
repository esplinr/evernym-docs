# What is a Credential Ecosystem?

A Credential Ecosystem is a group of enterprise entities that recognize, accept, and issue Credentials to individuals or other enterprises. They are essential in building Trust and Governance frameworks for governments, citizens, and business exchanges. A successful Credential Ecosystem is a cooperative effort from multiple entities dedicated to creating a set of standards for Credentials, DID registration, and tailored Proofs.

The Credential Village is a sandbox ecosystem that has been developed to illustrate how a multi-credential system can be rapidly deployed and build upon itself. 

<!-- ## [Creating a Credential]()

Creating a good Credential can take planning. This tutorial discusses how to create good schema and Credential Definitions for use between multiple entities. 

## [Complex Proofs and Predicates]()

Proof Templates and complex proofs, including Zero Knowledge Proofs, have multiple layers of complexity. With a single well-designed proof you can get a tremendous amount of information from a single Request, reducing time and consolidating data exchange. This tutorial explains Complex proofs from an architectural standpoint. -->
