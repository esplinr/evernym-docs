This content will introduce you to the exciting new world of self-sovereign identity and digital identity (sometimes called *decentralized-identity*) and many of the important problems it can be used to solve. The following content, descriptions, and links are designed to give you a learning experience that will teach you how the system works, and all of the many pieces of the puzzle that fit together. Self-Sovereign Identity is not just a single piece of technology, rather it uses several emerging and extant technologies along with a Trust Framework in order to create a *system* that can be used by products, services, individual entitities, and enterprise agencies for a world in which digital transactions are safer, more reliable, and more private than ever before.

## [The Emergence of Self-Sovereign Identity]()

What is Self-Sovereign Identity? Why is it important? How does Evernym, Sovrin, and Hyperledger factor in to all of this? What kind of future can we expect from the emergence of this technology and philosophy? This section will introduce you to the world of SSI and how it influences and affects you, the world around you, and the tenets of digital identity.

## [Mutually Authenticated Connections and DIDs](basics-connections/)

Everything in Self-Sovereign Identity starts with a mutually authenticated Connection. Find out how these are established, and how they form the foundation of the SSI framework.

## [Digital Credentials](basics-digital-credentials/)

A Credential is any attribute that can be offered, issued, and signed by the issuing entity. Credentials form the ecosystem of trust between consumers and enterprise. Learn how to plan and construct good Schema and Credential Definitions, and how to create a system to sign and issue them to consumers and enterprise customers alike.

## [Proofs and Predicates]()

A Proof Request is the method of consuming a Credential Attribute. Proof Requests can be as simple or complex as you want, with the ability to specify circumstances and parameters tailored to your needs. Proofs can also be set up with predicates, or "Zero Knowledge" parameters, allowing you to determine aspects of an Attribute without the attribute itself being revealed.

## [Revocations]()

Revocations are the state of the validity of any Credential, as issued to an Identity owner. Any Credential can be revoked at any time, which means that a registry of revocations must be maintained and checked against with the validation of any Credential from a Proof Request.

## [Data Privacy and Security]()

One of the foundational pillars of architecture that Evernym has adhered to is the absolute belief in your right to data privacy and security. By doing away with federated and siloed logins, passwords, and personal identifiers, the SSI system of Credential Exchange eliminates the need for secured databases, secured transactions, data administration, and enterprise database liability. This also means the only place your data is stored is with you, the Identity Holder, and nobody else. Your data remains with you, and nobody else. This massive shift in paradigm benefits both the consumer AND the enterprise agency or business.

## [The Sovrin Ledger]()

The Sovrin Ledger is the "Blockchain" element of the SSI formula, in which the distributed ledger is used to hold certain pieces of data. Enterprise DIDs, or Verifiers, are saved on the ledger, which allow that Verifier to write Schema, Credential Definitions, and Credential Issuance with the Verifier signature. Revocations also reside on the Ledger. Credentials themselves, however, *never get written to the Ledger*, but are instead issued and help by the individual.

## [Trust Frameworks and Governance]()

A Trust Framework is an ecosystem within which you can create, issue, and trust credentials from a specific set of signatories. Trust and Governance Frameworks are the legal infrastructure inside of which a credential ecosystem lives and thrives, whether that be for a Government, Human Being, Supply Chain Enterprise, or Medical framework. The concepts of "Trust" and "Governance" are elastic and flexible within the SSI system, being able to be shaped and formed to adhere to regulations (such as GDPR) and laws.

## [Digital Key Management]()

What happens when I lose my phone? Where do my credentials go? How can I back up and restore my wallet? All of these questions can be answered in this section focused on wallet restoration, backup, and management of your digital keys in the event that you lose your mobile device or it is stolen.

## [Agents and Agency]()

Credential Exchange requires that an Identity Holder, with a mobile device and wallet, is able to receive requests and offers from any Enterprise or other Agent. In order to process and transmit these Connection Offers, Credential Offers, Proof Requests, and Structured Messages, the Identity Wallet owner must have a way to manage them. Evernym hosts their own Enterprise and Consumer Agency Service, which creates Cloud Agents in order to manage requests for both the Enterprise and the Identity Owner (or Consumer).

## [Interoperability]()

Interoperability is the flexible putty that allows any system to work inside of the Evernym and Sovrin Self-Sovereign Identity architecture. Hyperledger Indy and Project Aries are examples of the open-source community and Evernym working together to create a set of standards and protocols that will work with any ledger in any country with any third-party software. -->
