# Using Verity UI and Connect.me

Verity UI is the NodeJS-based front end GUI for VCX and Libindy. While not
intended to be a production-level tool, Veruty UI is a great way to see how the
VCX libraries are used and handled by a NodeJS-based front-end running in an
html shell. This tutorial shows how to create Connections, Credential Schema,
Credential Definitions, Proof Requests, and how to share them all with a
Connect.me user. For testing purposes you can use the Verity UI and a copy of
Connect.me mobile to exchange credentials and proofs.

Connect.me is Evernym's mobile wallet app. It is developed in order to receive
Connection requests, Credential Offers, and Proof Requests. Connect.me
holds your Credentials for you and allows you to issue Proof Requests. Your Connect.me wallet is the only place these Credentials are
stored, so you know the data belongs to you and only you.
