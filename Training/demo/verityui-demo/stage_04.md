## Credential Offer

Offering a Credential to an Identity Holder is the 2nd Pillar of Verifiable Credential Exchange (VCX). We have previously defined the Credential as an Issuer (in this case TinyCorp) and now we will populate the data fields established in the schema, and then offer it to an Identity Holder through Connect.me. Once this Credential is held by the Identity Holder, it can be used in Proof Requests from any other party.

###  Step 1 : Create Credential Offer

Open the Credential Tab and Click on the "Issue A Digital Credential". This will bring up the Credential Issue Box, in which you can choose the Credential you wish to issue an Offer for, choose the Connection to make the Offer to, and fill out specific values for each of the fields. Once you have completed this you can click the bottom button, which issues a Credential Offer to the chosen Connection.

Fill out the fields and send the Credential Offer:

###  Step 2 : Accept Offer with Connect.me

The Credential Offer will be sent to the Connect.me user, and wait for acceptance by the Identity Owner. Once the Credential Offer has been accepted, Verity-UI will issue the Credential to the Identity Holder through the Connect.me wallet. You can look at the Credential in the Wallet as the Identity Holder and see the fields and data contained.

### What do I do with my Credential?

Now that you have issued yourself a Credential, you might wonder just exactly what you will do with it! In the next Step, you will see how you can use this Credential to prove your Identity to another Enterprise through a Proof Request. After Proving your Identity with the TinyCorp Credential, you may be able to unlock all kinds of other Credentials and access.
