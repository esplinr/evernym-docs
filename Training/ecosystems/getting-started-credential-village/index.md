Welcome to the Evernym Credential Village! We have created a Virtual Credential
Environment for you to discover, learn, and assist you with developing your
demos and prototypes. The Credential Village creates a Credential Exchange
Ecosystem which will help you visualize the coming world of Decentralized
Identity and Digital Credentials. It offers the following features for Early
Access Program Customers:

1. Credentials from persistent DID's that can be used for your Demo and Prototype Applications
2. A Visual Blueprint for building your own persistent VCX-based Web Apps
3. A Structured Message Machine for experiencing the power of Structured Messaging.
